/*
* I/O subsystem parameters
*
* The following parameters tweak the configuration of the GNU/Linux I/O subsystem. There are two major items
* one may want to tweak:
*
* - The amount of threads used for doing I/O: the IO_RX/TX_THREADS defines the amount of threads that may be used
*   for serving the ports. As a rule of thumb, one should configure:
*
*                 IO_RX_THREADS+IO_TX_THREADS+1 == Number of cores or CPUs of the system
*                 IO_RX_THREADS+IO_TX_THREADS   <= IO_MAX_THREADS
*
* - The amount of buffers: IO_BUFFERPOOL_CAPACITY defines the amount of pre-allocated buffers.
* - The number of (soft) queues per port: IO_IFACE_NUM_QUEUES
*
* It is recommended that IO_RX_THREADS >= IO_TX_THREADS
*
