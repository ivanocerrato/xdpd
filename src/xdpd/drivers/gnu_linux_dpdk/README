The GNU/Linux DPDK driver 
================================

Brief
-----

Platform driver using Intel's DPDK 

Requirements
------------

DPDK v1.7

Compilation
-----------

To compile xDPd with DPDK support, make sure it is configured like this (if libraries are not installed):

	CFLAGS="-L$RTE_SDK/lib/ -I$RTE_SDK/include/" CXXFLAGS="$CFLAGS" ../configure --with-hw-support=gnu-linux-dpdk --disable-silent-rules 

Note also that _before_ compiling, the file src/config.h should be revised to make sure that at least:

- IO_IFACE_NUM_QUEUES, RX_XXTHRESH and TX_XXTHRESH are correct according to your NIC's capabilities
- Core mask is at least 0x3 (2 cores)

To execute xdpd use the normal config file. Note that DPDK's driver will discover 1G ports as geXX and 10G as 10geXX.

Limitations
-----------

Note that current config.h cannot handle multiple configurations of ports and RX/TX thresholds. This will be fixed in following version

FAQ
---

* Why are some interfaces not recognised by xDPd? By default only tested devices are compiled by DPDK's PMDs; make sure all the device IDs are enabled when compiling DPDK. e.g. (E1000_DEV_ID_82583V):

* Which interface names are used in gnu-linux-dpdk? geXX and 10geXX. The discovered interfaces are listed on bootstrapping time.

* Why do I get the error 'PANIC in hal_driver_init(): Cannot init direct mbuf pool'? This is very likely due to insufficient hugepages memory. Try to increase the amount of hugepages memory. Alternatively you can reduce the amount of buffers allocated, by reducing `NB_MBUF` in `src/xdpd/drivers/gnu_linux_dpdk/src/config.h`.
